            <p>I was able to travel quite a lot before uni! I visited various countries in Europe, Asia and America but my most memorable would be a family cruise from US to Mexico where I got my first tattoo.</p>

              <p>My favourite trip was my first ever solo trip abroad! I went to Oslo, in Norway, just for 3 days, to celebrate my career change! I developed a taste for Brunost!</p>

              <h2>Lily</h2>
              <p>My favourite trip was when I backpacked South East Asia solo after uni. I did Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bali and the Philippines. It took 5 months and it was so much fun, I met so many amazing people. My favourite country was Vietnam!</p>
