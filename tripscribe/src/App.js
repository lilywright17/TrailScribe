              <p>The most memorable trip I had so far was my holiday in Crete, Greece. I still remember the pink sand and blue water in Elafonissi Beach. I enjoyed the food, wine and sunny weather for five days. Definitely, a place I will visit again.</p>

              <h2>Marta</h2>
              <p>Travelling is a big part of my life. I love it and travel quite often. One of my favourite trips ever was when I went to Sri Lanka. It was my first time visiting Asia and everyting seemed so exotic and exciting. The wildlife was spectacular. I loved going on safaris and seeing elephants, leopards, wild beasts and even a sloth bear! I got to see baby turtles hatching on a beach below a starry, stormy sky and making their way to the sea. And let's not forget the whale watching. It was a truly memeorable experience. </p>

              <p>My favourite trip was when I backpacked South East Asia solo after uni. I did Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bali and the Philippines. It took 5 months and it was so much fun, I met so many amazing people. My favourite country was Vietnam!</p>
