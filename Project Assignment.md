## PART 1 - Project Details

The team had several meetings on Google-Meet to brainstorm ideas for the purpose of this project. A [FigJam board](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1xX9t_kbum-0r8c762IYquuVazrl-3VS21qndpGN7OjA/viewer?f=0&pli=1) was used to suggest ideas and each team member voted for their favourite proposal.

All members approved the creation of TripScribe, a web application designed to function as a travel diary. Additionally, during the [Product Discovery - Brainstorm and Prioritise ](https://jamboard.google.com/d/14gcd8Ds6WTDvzmb_mynSRYiQvJlTTBC-6QW1z4ZtoE0/viewer?f=0) session, the team collaboratively proposed various features for the application and established the criteria for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### What is the concept/ what are you building? Think exactly about what needs to be built.

The TripScribe App that will allow a user to document their travel memories, add photos and notes about their experiences. They will be able to view past trips, update or delete them and add new ones. As future plans, we plan to implement interactivity with other users by adding comments, liking posts and tagging others. 

### Who will this help? Who’s your target audience? 

Travellers from all over the world. People who want to document and/or share their travels with families, friends and other travellers, as well as people who want to log their trips and keep it private, like a diary.

### How will you be working? What tools will help with that?

We will implement an Agile Methodology, utilizing the following tools:

* Trello: For tracking project progress, including tasks, responsibilities, deadlines, and documents.
* Google Meet: For regular team meetings.
* Jamboard: For brainstorming ideas.
* Slack: For regular communication exchanges.
* Figma: For creating wireframes.

### How are you going to organise the workload? Who does what and when?

To organize the workload for this project, each team member completed a SWOT analysis beforehand to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities for development, and potential threats. This process enabled us to define the roles of each team member effectively.

In the tables below, you can see the allocation of roles and tasks.

#### Design and Usability Choices
* **Color Scheme:** Blue and green were selected to evoke travel-related themes such as sky, sea, and land. For clarity, simplicity, and accessibility, we used only two main colors (in addition to black and white): #92C7CF and #476A6F. Following a Lighthouse report on the app, we may adjust the shades slightly to ensure a clear contrast between text and background colors.

* **Icons:** We utilized easily recognizable icons for navigation and actions, such as plus, user, map, view, trash can, and pencil for editing.

* **Layout:** After researching other desktop sites, we decided on a four-column view for the "My Trips" page to enhance user experience.
